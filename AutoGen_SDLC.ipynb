      "\n",
      "Requirements:\n",
      "1. Automatically assign task priority based on task deadlines, task dependencies, and user preferences.\n",
      "2. Tasks with closer deadlines should have higher priority.\n",
      "3. Tasks blocking other tasks due to dependencies should have higher priority.\n",
      "4. Users can mark tasks as important, which affects the task priority.\n",
      "5. The system should handle multiple users and tasks simultaneously.\n",
      "6. The system should provide an intuitive interface for users to interact with.\n",
      "\n",
      "High-Level Design:\n",
      "1. Database Schema:\n",
      "   - Users table: Store user information including preferences.\n",
      "   - Tasks table: Store task details such as deadlines, dependencies, and priority.\n",
      "   - Dependencies table: Map task dependencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Priority Calculation Algorithm:\n",
      "   - Calculate task priority based on:\n",
      "     - Deadline proximity.\n",
      "     - Number of tasks dependent on the task.\n",
      "     - User preferences.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. User Interface:\n",
      "   - User dashboard to view, create, update, and mark tasks as important.\n",
      "   - Allow users to set deadlines and task dependencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. System Components:\n",
      "   - Task Priority Service: Orchestrates the priority calculation for tasks.\n",
      "   - User Service: Manages user preferences and task assignments.\n",
      "   - Database Service: Handles database operations.\n",
      "   - User Interface Service: Provides the interface for users to interact with the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Task Priority Assignment Workflow:\n",
      "   - When a new task is created or updated, trigger the priority calculation algorithm.\n",
      "   - Update the task priority based on the calculated value.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Scalability Considerations:\n",
      "   - Use a scalable database solution to handle a large number of users and tasks.\n",
      "   - Implement caching mechanisms for improved performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the Task Priority System should provide a seamless experience for users in managing their tasks based on deadlines, dependencies, and preferences. The system should be modular, scalable, and user-friendly.\n",
